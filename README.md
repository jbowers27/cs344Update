#Updating Nvidia's Introduction to Parallel Programming in CUDA

The lectures from [Nvidia's CS344](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344/) are still available today, but the IDE within Udacity is no longer functioning. The only option for completing the assignments of this course is local development, but the existing problem set repositories from Udacity are now many years out-of-date. The usage and syntax of major dependencies like OpenCV have changed drastically in the years since, making local development a hassle. As I update these projects, I'll be placing them here. At present this update
is for UNIX-based systems with potential support for OSX developers at a later time. I hope that this repository can serve to streamline CUDA-learning for other programmers like me.

## Current Compatibility:
* CUDA 11.0
* OpenCV 4.4
* CMake 3.16
